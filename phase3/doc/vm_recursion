Purpose:
Test the demand paging and reading/writing memory.

Usage:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_recursion.coff -# coffPar0=xxx,coffPar1=xxx,swapFile=xxx

History:
2008-12-26 Xiangru Chen: The first version.

Arguments:
coffPar0: the depth of the recursion. At each level, an array of page-size will be placed in the stack.
coffPar1: the skip factor. It means that, only (PAGE_SIZE / (2 ^ "skip factor")) bytes in each page will be used. When the test seems too slow, increase this value to speed it up.
swapFile: the name of the swap file.

Sample:
-- nachos.ag.VMGrader -x vm_recursion.coff -# coffPar0=20,coffPar1=0,swapFile=SWAP0

Restrictions:
To run this test, the number of physical pages should be no more than 16.

Note:
This test needs a stack of more than 8 pages, if your stack size is fixed at 8, you can feel free to ignore this test:p
